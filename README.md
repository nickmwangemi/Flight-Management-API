  }
}
```

## Constraints & Validations

1. Aircraft are identified by unique serial numbers
2. Flights must have a future departure time
3. Arrival time must be after departure time
4. Airport codes must be valid ICAO codes (4 letters)
5. Aircraft can only be deleted if not assigned to any flights

## Technical Implementation

- Built with Flask for the web framework
- SQLAlchemy for ORM and database operations
- SQLite for local development database
- Unit tests with Python's unittest framework
- RESTful API design principles

## Future Enhancements

- Authentication and authorization
- Pagination for large datasets
- Additional reporting capabilities
- Real-time flight tracking
- Integration with external aviation APIs

# Database Seeding

I've created a database seeding script (`seed_db.py`) that will populate your database with sample data for development and testing purposes. Here's how to use it:

## Features

- Creates a configurable number of aircraft with realistic manufacturer and model combinations
- Generates unique serial numbers for each aircraft
- Creates flights between major international airports with realistic departure/arrival times
- Assigns aircraft to flights (with some flights intentionally left unassigned)
- Handles database clearing and re-seeding

## Usage

### Basic Seeding

To populate your database with default values (15 aircraft and 50 flights):

```bash
python seed_db.py
```

### Clear and Re-seed

To clear the existing data and re-seed the database:

```bash
python seed_db.py --clear
```

### Only Clear

To clear the database without adding new seed data:

```bash
python seed_db.py --clear --only-clear
```

### Customizing Seed Data

You can modify the `seed_database()` function call in the script to customize the number of aircraft and flights:

```python
# To create 20 aircraft and 100 flights
seed_database(aircraft_count=20, flight_count=100)
```

## Sample Data Generated

### Aircraft

- Manufacturers include: Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier, Embraer, and Cessna
- Models appropriate to each manufacturer (e.g., Boeing 737, Airbus A320)
- Unique serial numbers in the format `[Manufacturer Initial][Model Code]-[4-digit number]`

### Flights

- Randomly selected departure and arrival airports from a list of major international airports
- Departure times within the next 30 days
- Realistic flight durations
- 90% of flights have aircraft assigned; 10% are unassigned

## Integration with the Application

This seeding script uses your existing application context and models, so it's fully integrated with your Flask application. You can run it independently or integrate it into your application startup process for development environments.
